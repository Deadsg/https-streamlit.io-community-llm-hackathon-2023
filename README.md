We are describing a system where each "agent" or component operates within a directory-based environment. Each agent reads and processes instructions from files, interacts with the directory structure, and can create new files or data as needed. The agents can communicate with each other through a shared Git repository hosted by a Streamlit server.

This approach allows for distributed and collaborative processing of tasks within the directory structure. Agents follow instructions provided in specific files, and these instructions guide their actions and interactions with the data and other agents.

It's an interesting concept and could have various applications, especially for tasks involving data processing, automation, and collaboration.
